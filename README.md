# Hey there! I'm Lucas Marques 👋  
Welcome to my GitHub!

👨‍💻 I'm a Full Stack Developer passionate about building mobile and web apps. Currently, I'm deeply focused on Flutter and Dart, creating cross-platform applications.

💼 I'm currently working at **Lifemed** (Pelotas, RS) as a developer on a legacy built with JSF. The project, called **Lifemed Connect**, is a technical assistance management platform that handles service orders, support tickets, and parts requests — fully integrated with **TOTVS Protheus**.

🚀 I'm always learning and working on new ideas.  
🎯 Right now, I'm improving my skills in Flutter and mobile development. Check out my learning project: [Skyly](https://github.com/codedwithlucas/skyly)  
👨‍👧 Proud dad to Isabela — she's my biggest motivation!  
🏎️ Also, a big Formula 1 fan. Love watching the races every weekend!
